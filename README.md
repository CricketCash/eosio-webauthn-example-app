# EOSIO WebAuthn Browser Based Signature Example App

[![EOSIO Labs](https://img.shields.io/badge/EOSIO-Labs-5cb3ff.svg)](#about-eosio-labs)

# Overview
 
This example application demonstrates WebAuthn based: 

- blockchain account creation for private chains
- blockchain transaction signatures for private chains

## About EOSIO Labs

EOSIO Labs repositories are experimental.  Developers in the community are encouraged to use EOSIO Labs repositories as the basis for code and concepts to incorporate into their applications. Community members are also welcome to contribute and further develop these repositories. Since these repositories are not supported by Block.one, we may not provide responses to issue reports, pull requests, updates to functionality, or other requests from the community, and we encourage the community to take responsibility for these.

# Build and run this app

```
yarn
rm -rf node_modules/eosjs && bash -c "cd external/eosjs && yarn" && yarn add file:external/eosjs
rm -rf dist && yarn server
```

Connect to http://localhost:8000

# Limitations

* server only supports a single client (browser tab) connecting to it
* server only supports a single user; it assumes all stored keys belong to that user
* server only supports a single hardware key; it assumes all stored keys came from that key
* `createKey` in `ClientRoot.tsx`
    * assumes it's served from localhost; other domains will break
    * hard codes the `user` field
    * hard codes the `challenge` field; this should be randomly generated by the server then checked by the server
* If `keys.json` (maintained by the server) is lost, then the keypairs become inaccessible. Webauthn doesn't provide a way to recover from this.

# Create test chain with webauthn support

This starts a minimal test chain with some upgrades activated. This guide assumes you're already familiar with creating and using test chains.

## Prerequisites

* Install eosio webauthn_wip branch
* Install eosio.cdt v1.6.x
* Use the eosio.cdt to build eosio.contracts v1.7.0 RC1

## Create a wallet, or unlock existing

Use `cleos wallet create` or `cleos wallet unlock`

## Add the default key

```
cleos wallet import --private-key 5KQwrPbwdL6PhXujxW37FSSQZ1JiwsST4cqQzDeyXtP79zkvFD3
```

## Create a test chain

This will create a fresh chain in directory `my-chain`. `chain_api_plugin` and `producer_api_plugin` enable the commands which follow.

```
mkdir my-chain
cd my-chain
nodeos -d ./data --config-dir ./config --plugin eosio::chain_api_plugin --plugin eosio::producer_api_plugin --http-validate-host 0 --access-control-allow-origin "*" -p eosio -e 2>stderr &
```

## Preactivate feature

Do this before installing eosio.bios:

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8888/v1/producer/schedule_protocol_feature_activations -d '{"protocol_features_to_activate": ["0ec7e080177b2c02b278d5088611686b49d739925a92d9bfcacd7fc6b74053bd"]}' | jq
```

## Install contracts, activate webauthn keys, and create tokens

```
cleos create account eosio eosio.token EOS6MRyAjQq8ud7hVNYcfnVPJqcVpscN5So8BhtHuGYqET5GDW5CV
cleos set contract eosio .../path/to/eosio.contracts/build/contracts/eosio.bios -p eosio
cleos set contract eosio.token .../path/to/eosio.contracts/build/contracts/eosio.token -p eosio.token
cleos push action eosio activate '["4fca8bd82bbd181e714e283f83e1b45d95ca5af40fb89ad3977b653c448f78c2"]' -p eosio
cleos push action eosio.token create '["eosio","10000000.0000 SYS"]' -p eosio.token
cleos push action eosio.token issue '["eosio","10000000.0000 SYS",""]' -p eosio
```

## Use app to generate 2 keys. Use them below:

```
cleos create account eosio usera PUB_WA_...
cleos create account eosio userb PUB_WA_...
cleos create account eosio userc PUB_WA_...
cleos create account eosio userd PUB_WA_...
cleos transfer eosio usera "1000.0000 SYS" ""
cleos transfer eosio userb "1000.0000 SYS" ""
cleos transfer eosio userc "1000.0000 SYS" ""
cleos transfer eosio userd "1000.0000 SYS" ""
```
