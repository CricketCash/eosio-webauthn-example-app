## Build and run

```
yarn
rm -rf node_modules/eosjs && bash -c "cd external/eosjs && yarn" && yarn add file:external/eosjs
rm -rf dist && yarn server
```

Connect to http://localhost:8000

## Limitations

* server only supports a single client (browser tab) connecting to it
* server only supports a single user; it assumes all stored keys belong to that user
* server only supports a single hardware key; it assumes all stored keys came from that key
* `createKey` in `ClientRoot.tsx`
    * assumes it's served from localhost; other domains will break
    * hard codes the `user` field
    * hard codes the `challenge` field; this should be randomly generated by the server then checked by the server
* If `keys.json` (maintained by the server) is lost, then the keypairs become inaccessible. Webauthn doesn't provide a way to recover from this.
